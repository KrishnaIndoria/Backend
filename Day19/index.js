// methods in mongoose

// environment variables (.env) 
// in .env file we write all our sensitive data and use them in the main code as variables
// .env acts as global object.

// dotnev is a module tht loads this data from .env file to process.env(global object)
// basically they bring the data from .env to main code as variables in process.env

// this is done in above folders check once 

// we do not push this .env on github as it has sensitive(secret) data
